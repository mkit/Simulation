Simulation
==========

This is an OMNeT++ project containing the ICS scenario network model. 
It has been developed under the OMNet++ IDE version 4.3 and aims to mimic vehicle-to-ICS (and vice versa) communication.

The simulation sceanrio accounts for the message prioritization protocol and can be configured to include different packet losses.
